# cerebral-game-library-client

Single-page application web client built with React + Redux

## What's inside

- [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/) components
- [Redux Forms](redux-form.com) to handle form state
- [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) to handle API calls
- [nwb](https://github.com/insin/nwb) to handle serving and building the app.
It abstracts the usual React boilerplate (hi Webpack) and provides a development environment with hot reloading.
